# RockPaperScissorsPython
A simple Python implementation of the classic Rock, Paper, Scissors game with a text-based interface.

## How to Play:
- When prompted, the player selects their move by entering:
  - `0` for Rock
  - `1` for Paper
  - `2` for Scissors
- The computer randomly selects its move.
- The game then compares the player's choice with the computer's choice and determines the winner:
  - Rock crushes Scissors
  - Scissors cut Paper
  - Paper covers Rock
- The game announces the result: whether it's a draw, the player wins, or the player loses.

## Features:
- Simple and intuitive text-based interface.
- Visual representation of the chosen options (Rock, Paper, Scissors).
- Randomized computer choice to ensure fairness.

## How to Run:
1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Run the script in your terminal or command prompt using:

  ```bash
  python rock_paper_scissors.py
  ```
4. Follow the on-screen instructions to play.

Enjoy playing RockPaperScissors and test your luck against the computer!
